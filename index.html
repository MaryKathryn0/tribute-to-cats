                    - If you are in the flashlight business you most likely heard
                    of Envey, the McMeowser family matriarch. Born in Alaska, Envey
                    dreamed of lighting up her world and in 1912 she purchased an
                    old stapler factory and turned into <strong>McMeowser Lights & Lasers</strong>,

                    later had their first child, Dudley. It was said tht Angelina
                    was very close with her mother in law Envey which sometimes
                    caused family squabbles.

                    <strong>Bob Katz-McMeowser</strong>
                    - Bob Katz was born in Bellvue, Washington, where his father Ali was a biologist
                    and his mother Kallieco raised the children. When he was seven years old, his family
                    moved to Anchorage, Alaska, where he grew up and later became a pilot and met Envey.
                    Bob fell in love with Envey and her entrepreneurial spirit but declined her wish to take
                    her maiden name and instead compromised by using a hyphen and adding McMeowser.

                    <strong>Jen-Anne Tawnique McMeowser</strong>
                    - Jen-Anne was originally poised to take over the McMeowser family
                    flashlight business after she graduated from the prestigous
                    Stanford University. However Jen-Anne got in with the wrong crowd
                    and ended up a member of the Cats & Claws gang. Jen-Anne worked her
                    way up the gang to become its leader and made a signifcant fortune
                    in pirated tuna. Though she posed in this family portrait there was always
                    a family rift regarding her mothers close relationship with her
                    sister-in-law Angelina.
